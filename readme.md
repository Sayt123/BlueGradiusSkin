# My UnleashX Skins

### Blue Gradius
A bit rough esepcially in 1080 or 720 resolutions. This was made waaay back in 2009 and the background video looked far more tolerable on a CRT! I might revisit this sometime and update the skin.

### Bebop
Designed around a Cowboy Bebop theme, the background video tends to lag when menuing etc. Might revisit this as well sometime.
